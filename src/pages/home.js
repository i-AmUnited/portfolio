        I'm a versatile UI/UX Designer with over 5 years of experience, blending
        a strong design foundation with front-end development knowledge to
        create visually appealing, user-centric, and practical digital
        experiences. My work spans agencies and startups, where I've designed
        mobile and web product interfaces that align user needs with business
        goals. Immersing myself in web3 and fintech, I'm all about clarity and
        turning good ideas into great reality.
